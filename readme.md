Compile MDX to JavaScript in Rust.

## When should I use this?

You can use this crate when you’re dealing with the Rust language and want
to compile MDX to JavaScript.
To parse the MDX format to a syntax tree, use [`markdown-rs`][markdown-rs] instead.

This project does not yet support plugins.
To benefit from the unified (remark and rehype) ecosystem, use
[`@mdx-js/mdx`][mdx-js].

## What is this?

This Rust crate works exactly like the npm package [`@mdx-js/mdx`][mdx-js].
It uses the Rust crates [`markdown-rs`][markdown-rs] and [SWC][] to deal with the
markdown and JavaScript inside MDX.

## Questions

*   to learn MDX, see [`mdxjs.com`][mdx-site]
*   for the API, see the [crate docs][docs]
*   for questions, see [Discussions][chat]
*   to help, see [contribute][] or [sponsor][] below

## Install

With [Rust][] (rust edition 2018+, ±version 1.56+), install with `cargo`:

```sh
cargo add mdxjs
```

## Use

```rs
extern crate mdxjs;

fn main() -> Result<(), String> {
    println!(
        "{}",
        mdxjs::compile(
            r###"
import {Chart} from './snowfall.js'
export const year = 2018

# Last year’s snowfall

In {year}, the snowfall was above average.
It was followed by a warm spring which caused
flood conditions in many of the nearby rivers.

<Chart year={year} color="#fcb32c" />
"###,
            &Default::default()
        )?
    );

    Ok(())
}
```

Yields (prettified):

```javascript
import {Fragment as _Fragment, jsx as _jsx, jsxs as _jsxs} from 'react/jsx-runtime'
import {Chart} from './snowfall.js'
export const year = 2018

function _createMdxContent(props) {
  const _components = Object.assign({h1: 'h1', p: 'p'}, props.components)
  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {
    children: [
      _jsx(_components.h1, {children: 'Last year’s snowfall'}),
      '\n',
      _jsxs(_components.p, {
        children: [
          'In ',
          year,
          ', the snowfall was above average.\nIt was followed by a warm spring which caused\nflood conditions in many of the nearby rivers.'
        ]
      }),
      '\n',
      _jsx(Chart, {year: year, color: '#fcb32c'})
    ]
  })
}

function MDXContent(props = {}) {
  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = props.components || {}
  return MDXLayout
    ? _jsx(MDXLayout, Object.assign({}, props, {children: _jsx(_createMdxContent, props)}))
    : _createMdxContent(props)
}

export default MDXContent
```

## API

`mdxjs-rs` exposes
[`compile`](https://docs.rs/mdxjs/latest/mdxjs/fn.compile.html),
[`JsxRuntime`](https://docs.rs/mdxjs/latest/mdxjs/enum.JsxRuntime.html),
[`Options`](https://docs.rs/mdxjs/latest/mdxjs/struct.Options.html),
and a few other structs and enums.

See the [crate docs][docs] for more info.

## Project

### Test

`mdxjs-rs` is tested with a lot of tests.
These tests reach all branches in the code, which means that this project has
100% code coverage.

The following bash scripts are useful when working on this project:

*   run examples:
    ```sh
    RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run --example lib
    ```
*   format:
    ```sh
    cargo fmt && cargo clippy --examples --tests --benches --fix
    ```
*   lint:
    ```sh
    cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy --examples --tests --benches
    ```
*   test:
    ```sh
    RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo test
    ```
*   docs:
    ```sh
    cargo doc --document-private-items
    ```

### Version

`mdxjs-rs` follows [SemVer](https://semver.org).

### Security

MDX is a programming language.
It is JavaScript.
It is not safe to let people you don’t trust write MDX.
